# PearlHacks2023
My first hackathon. 

This notebook is my effort to tidy up what we did between 4pm and midnight and 9:30-11:30am the following day. 

We decided to attempt a challenge to use real estate data. We took the opportunity to relearn our time series class material but implement it in python! Each of the three team members took a different county.  The original data was converted to a csv file from this file: https://redfin-public-data.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/redfin_market_tracker/county_market_tracker.tsv000.gz
